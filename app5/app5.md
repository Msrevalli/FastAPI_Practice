Sure! Here’s a detailed explanation of this modular FastAPI app using PostgreSQL with async SQLModel and Pydantic Settings for config management.

---

### Overall idea

This app is structured to keep code clean, maintainable, and scalable by splitting responsibilities across multiple files/folders — following common best practices in FastAPI development.

* **Modular**: Separate files for config, DB, models, schemas, routes.
* **Async with PostgreSQL**: Uses SQLModel + `asyncpg` for async DB access.
* **Config via `.env`**: Centralized config management with Pydantic Settings.
* **CRUD operations**: Full Create, Read, Update, Delete for `Book` entity.
* **Dependency injection**: DB session is injected into routes via FastAPI's `Depends`.

### 1. Project structure

```
bookstore/
├── run.py            # Entrypoint of the app, create FastAPI app and include routers
├── .env              # Environment variables (DB URL)
├── requirements.txt  # Python dependencies
└── src/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── config.py     # Config management with Pydantic
    ├── db.py         # DB engine and async session setup, DB init
    └── books/
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── models.py  # SQLModel ORM Book model (DB table schema)
        ├── schemas.py # Pydantic schemas for request/response validation
        └── routes.py  # FastAPI router with book CRUD endpoints
```

---

### 2. `src/config.py`

* Uses **Pydantic Settings** to load `DATABASE_URL` from `.env` file.
* Centralizes config so you can easily add other env variables later.
* `Config = Settings()` exposes an instance for app-wide use.

---

### 3. `src/db.py`

* Creates an **async SQLAlchemy engine** with `create_async_engine` using the `DATABASE_URL` from config.
* Defines an **async sessionmaker** to provide `AsyncSession` objects for DB access.
* `init_db()` asynchronously creates all tables in DB based on SQLModel metadata during app startup.

---

### 4. `src/books/models.py`

* Defines the **Book** table with SQLModel ORM.
* Uses Python typing and `Field` for metadata.
* `id` is primary key and auto-incremented.
* Other fields represent book info.

---

### 5. `src/books/schemas.py`

* Pydantic models define **request and response data shapes**:

  * `BookCreate` for new book input
  * `BookRead` for output (includes `id`)
  * `BookUpdate` for patch updates (all optional fields could be made optional, here for simplicity all required)

---

### 6. `src/books/routes.py`

* Creates a FastAPI **APIRouter** for book-related routes.
* Defines dependency `get_session()` which yields an async DB session (injected into route handlers).
* CRUD endpoints:

  * `GET /` - List all books (async DB query)
  * `POST /` - Create new book, commit to DB
  * `GET /{book_id}` - Get single book by ID, 404 if not found
  * `PATCH /{book_id}` - Update partial book data, 404 if not found
  * `DELETE /{book_id}` - Delete book by ID, 404 if not found

All routes are async, use SQLModel ORM for DB operations.

---

### 7. `run.py`

* Creates FastAPI app instance.
* Includes book router under `/books` prefix.
* Calls `init_db()` on startup event to create tables.
* This is your app entrypoint, run with `uvicorn run:app --reload`.

---

### 8. `.env`

* Holds your database connection string securely outside source code.
* Example PostgreSQL async URL:

  ```
  postgresql+asyncpg://username:password@localhost:5432/dbname
  ```

---

### 9. `requirements.txt`

* Lists Python packages needed:

  * `fastapi` - web framework
  * `uvicorn[standard]` - ASGI server with reload
  * `sqlmodel` - ORM & Pydantic model integration
  * `asyncpg` - async PostgreSQL driver
  * `pydantic-settings` - for config loading from `.env`

---

### How to run

* Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
* Make sure PostgreSQL is running and `.env` is configured
* Start the app:

```bash
uvicorn run:app --reload
```

* Test endpoints under `/books` path with any HTTP client (curl, Postman, browser).

---

### Summary

This modular design cleanly separates concerns:

* Config loading ✅
* DB connection management ✅
* ORM models ✅
* API schemas ✅
* Route handlers with async DB sessions ✅

This setup is ideal for production apps needing async DB access with FastAPI + PostgreSQL.
You can later add migrations, auth, or advanced features without messing up this clean structure.

If you want, I can also help you write migrations or improve this further!
